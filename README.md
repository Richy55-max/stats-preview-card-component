# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component

![Design preview for the Stats preview card component coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

Thanks for checking out this front-end coding challenge.

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io) challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.


## The challenge

Challenge is to build out this card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

I learned to change image background-color on hover

### Continued development 

I want to continue incorporating new things I learn into my Frontend Mentor projects.


### Useful resources

- [MDN WEB DOCS](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33986068/change-image-background-color-on-hover) - This allowed me to know how the content of an element should blend with the content of the parent element and its background using the mix-blend-mode property... I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
